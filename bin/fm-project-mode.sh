# Resolve a project's REGISTERED delivery posture from the data/projects.md registry.
# Prints three words to stdout: "<mode> <yolo> <forge>" where mode is one of
# no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only, yolo is on|off, and forge is none|gerrit.
#
# MECHANICAL CONSUMERS ONLY. This answers "what posture did the captain register
# for this project", never "how does this task ship". A task's delivery mode and
# yolo are resolved by firstmate at intake and passed explicitly to
# bin/fm-brief.sh, bin/fm-spawn.sh, and bin/fm-promote.sh (AGENTS.md section 7).
# The consumers are bin/fm-fleet-sync.sh (skip local-only clones),
# bin/fm-home-seed.sh and bin/fm-remote-home-seed.sh (refuse local-only seeding,
# run no-mistakes init), bin/fm-spawn.sh's advisory registry-deviation notice plus
# its forge agreement and yolo refusal, and bin/fm-promote.sh, which takes the
# forge binding from here because it is a project fact rather than a task choice.
#
# Registry line format (data/projects.md):
#   - <name> - <desc> (added <date>)                  -> no-mistakes off none  (legacy default)
#   - <name> [<mode>] - <desc> (added <date>)          -> <mode> off none
#   - <name> [<mode> +yolo] - <desc> (added <date>)    -> <mode> on none
#   - <name> [<mode> forge=gerrit] - <desc> (added <date>) -> <mode> off gerrit
# `+yolo` and `forge=` are order-independent annotation tokens that may appear
# together; only the FIRST token is read as the mode. They are the ONLY tokens an
# annotation may carry beside that mode: anything else is refused rather than
# ignored, because a silently dropped `forg=gerrit` binds no forge at all.
#
# Registered modes:
#   no-mistakes            full pipeline -> PR -> configured merge authority (default)
#   direct-PR              push + PR via gh-axi, no pipeline
#   local-only             local branch, no remote/PR, guarded local merge
#   no-mistakes-prod-only  a conditional policy, not a task mode: firstmate
#                          classifies each task's surface at intake (the
#                          project-management skill owns that classification).
#                          Mechanical output maps it to its most rigorous leg,
#                          no-mistakes, so sync, seeding, and init treat such a
#                          project as the remote-backed pipeline project it is.
# yolo (orthogonal) = merge authority only: when on, firstmate merges green,
#   in-scope work itself (AGENTS.md section 7).
# forge (orthogonal, and orthogonal to yolo too) = which forge the project's
#   remote actually is, never inferred from mode, remote name, host, or protocol.
#   `none` means a forge whose pull requests and checks no-mistakes already
#   drives, and `gerrit` means a Gerrit server: no pull requests, no forge CI the
#   pipeline can watch, so no-mistakes runs as a review pass that stops at a
#   ready branch (bin/fm-dod-lib.sh owns what that changes for a worker).
#   The binding is EXPLICIT because a provider family must never be guessed;
#   proposing it from a protocol fact such as port 29418 or a refs/for push
#   target belongs to project-add intake, not to a use-time lookup.
#
# A registered `forge=gerrit` project reports yolo=off with an explicit stderr
# refusal, on the captain's decision of 2026-09-15: a Gerrit Code-Review+2 is a
# positive attributed claim that a named human approved, read by colleagues and
# by any audit, and firstmate must not manufacture one.
#
# --raw prints the registered annotation unmapped, so a caller that must tell a
# conditional policy apart from a flat mode sees "no-mistakes-prod-only" itself.
# It affects the mode field only.
#
# An unknown/missing project or unknown mode falls back to "no-mistakes off none" and
# warns to stderr, so a typo never silently drops the gate. An unrecognized
# annotation token is REFUSED instead - both a `forge=` value outside the closed
# set and a token the parser does not know at all, such as `forg=gerrit` or a bare
# `gerrit`: nothing is printed to stdout and the exit status is 3, naming the bad
# token and the accepted set. A mistyped forge resolved to "no registered forge"
# would hand a Gerrit project the pull-request contract this binding exists to
# prevent, so it fails closed rather than degrading. An absent or empty `forge=`
# value is not a typo and still means no registered forge, and an annotation with
# no tokens at all keeps the legacy default.
