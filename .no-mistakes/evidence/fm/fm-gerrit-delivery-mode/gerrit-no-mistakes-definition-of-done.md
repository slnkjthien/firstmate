# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=no-mistakes forge=gerrit
This project's review server has no pull requests and no forge CI the pipeline can watch, so **no-mistakes runs here as a review pass that ends at a ready branch**, not as a gate in front of a remote.
Pass `--skip push,pr,ci` on every `no-mistakes axi run` for this task, and skip nothing else: `review`, `test`, `document`, and `lint` are the whole point of the run.
Those three are the only steps that reach a forge, and skipping them is a supported outcome, not a degraded one - the run still finishes `status: completed`, `outcome: passed`.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When you believe it is complete, append `done [at=<epoch>]: {summary}` to the status file and stop.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and `no-mistakes axi run --help` plus the `help` lines in each `axi` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass `--intent` as only this brief's `## Captain's intent` subsection body, not its heading, plus any later words the captain actually said.
Preserve the actual words without adding speaker labels or direct address; the subsection heading supplies provenance outside the pipeline input.
For a legacy brief with no such subsection, include only words on lines marked `[captain] `, excluding that metadata prefix; never copy its mixed `# Task` wholesale.
If it has no provenance-marked captain words, stop and ask firstmate instead of starting no-mistakes.
Do not include `## Firstmate spec`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
The `--intent` string you pass must be self-sufficient: that string plus the codebase must let a reader reconstruct roughly the same specification, without depending on a separate report, a PR, or context that lives only in this conversation.
When the captain's intent refers to a report, decision, or PR ("do items 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the report"), write the substance of the referenced items into `--intent` in the captain's terms, not only the pointer; that substance is the captain's ask by reference, while Firstmate's build instructions and your own decisions still stay out.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich `--intent` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

One drive call blocks until the next gate or outcome, which routinely outlives what your harness lets a single command run: Claude Code kills a command at ten minutes maximum, while one fix round is capped around thirty minutes and up to three rounds chain.
So background the drive call and poll `no-mistakes axi status` from a separate call instead of sitting in one blocking hold your harness will kill.
Where a harness's own command limit is not established, assume it bounds commands and use that same background-and-poll shape.
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies `ask-user-authority` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with `no-mistakes axi respond` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass `--yes` (or `-y`) to `no-mistakes axi run` or `no-mistakes axi respond`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

Because `push` is skipped, the pipeline's fixes DO NOT arrive in your checkout: each fix round commits onto a branch inside no-mistakes' own local gate repository, and with no push nothing carries those commits back to you.
Your tree never goes dirty and nothing interrupts you, so a passed run whose fixes are still in the gate looks exactly like a passed run whose fixes you already have.
You may not report ready until you have closed that gap:
1. After the run reaches its outcome, read `branch_sync.next_action` from `no-mistakes axi status`.
2. When its code is `recover_custody`, run the exact command that status prints - `no-mistakes axi sync --recover` - and confirm `branch_sync.state` comes back `custody_returned` on a clean tree. The printed command is authoritative if it differs.
3. Confirm with `git log` that `fm/apps-1` now carries every fix commit the run made, whether or not step 2 was needed.
An unrecovered fix round is an unfinished task, never housekeeping: reporting ready without it is how the UNFIXED code gets published.

When the run's outcome is passed and step 3 holds, append `done [at=<epoch>]: ready in branch fm/apps-1 - no-mistakes passed, fixes recovered` and stop. You are finished.
There is no PR URL and no CI result to report, and publishing this branch for review is not yours to do: firstmate pushes your branch to the review server on the captain's explicit authority, and the task stays open until a human reviewer submits the change.
